# Run k0s worker nodes in Windows

**IMPORTANT**: Windows support for k0s is under active development and **must be** considered experimental.

## Prerequisites

The cluster must be running at least one worker node and control plane on Linux, but you can use Windows to run additional worker nodes.

The Windows system must follow the overall (k0s system requirements)[system-requirements.md]. You will also need to install Mirantis Container Runtime on the Windows node(s), as it is required for the initial Calico set up).

**TODO:** Instructions for installing MCR

## Run k0s

**TODO:** Instructions for downloading k0s.exe

**Note**: The k0s.exe supervises kubelet.exe and kube-proxy.exe.

During the first run, the calico install script is created as `C:\bootstrap.ps1`. This bootstrap script downloads the Calico binaries, builds the pause container and sets up the vSwitch settings.

Initiate the Cluster control with the correct config:

```shell
k0s worker --cri-socket=remote:npipe:////./pipe/containerd-containerd --cidr-range=<cidr_range> --cluster-dns=<clusterdns> --api-server=<k0s api> <token>
```

## Configuration

### Strict-affinity

You must enable strict affinity to run the windows node.

If the `spec.network.calico.withWindowsNodes` field is set to `true` (it is set to `false` by default) the additional calico related manifest `/var/lib/k0s/manifests/calico/calico-IPAMConfig-ipamconfig.yaml` is created with the following values:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: crd.projectcalico.org/v1
kind: IPAMConfig
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  strictAffinity: true
```

Alternately, you can manually execute calicoctl:

```shell
calicoctl ipam configure --strictaffinity=true
```

### Network connectivity in AWS

Disable the `Change Source/Dest. Check` option for the network interface attached to your EC2 instance. In AWS, the console option for the network interface is in the **Actions** menu.

### Hacks

k0s offers the following CLI arguments in lieu of a formal means for passing cluster settings from controller plane to worker:

- cidr-range
- cluster-dns
- api-server

## Useful commands

### Run pod with cmd.exe shell

```shell
kubectl run win --image=hello-world:nanoserver --command=true -i --attach=true -- cmd.exe
```

### Manifest for pod with IIS web-server

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: iis
spec:
  containers:
  - name: iis
    image: mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore/iis
    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
```
