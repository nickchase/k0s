# Multi-Command Plans

Autopilot relies on a `Plan` for defining the `Command`s that should be
executed, the Signal Nodes that each should be run on, and the status of
each `Command`.

A Plan:

* Defines one or many `Command`s that specify what actions should be performed.
* Specifies how Signal Nodes should be discovered per-`Command`.
* Saves the status of the Plan execution by resolved Signal Nodes

A Command:

An instructional step inside of a Plan that is applied against a Signal Node.

A Signal Node:

Any node (controller or worker) that can receive updates with Autopilot.

## Execution

The execution of a `Plan` is the result of processing `Command`s through
a number of Processing States.

When a `Plan` is executed, each of the `Command`s are executed in the order
of their appearance in the `Plan`.

A `Plan` transitions to the next `Command` only when the current `Command` posts
a state of `Completed`. Any `Command` that posts one of the recognized Error States will result in the
current `Command` and `Plan` to abort processing, and the status of the `Command` and Plan will reflect this state.

A `Plan` is considered finished only when all of its defined `Command`s post a
`Completed` state.

## Status

The progress and state of each `Command` is recorded in the Plan status.

Every `Command` in the `Plan` has an associated status entry with the same index
as the `Command` For example, the second `Command` in a `Plan` has an index of `1`, and so does its status. The status of all `Command`s is taken into consideration when determining whether the
`Plan` is finished.

## Example

The following is an example of a `Plan` that has been applied and is currently being
processed by autopilot.

```

* Lines 7-33 are the two `Command`s that make up this `Plan` -- an `airgapupdate` and `k0supdate`.
* Lines 38-55 are the associated status entries for the two `Command`s.

The state of this `Plan` excerpt is that autopilot has successfully processed the `Plan`, and
has begun processing the `airgapupdate` `Command`. Its status indicates `SignalSent` which means
that the Signal Node has been sent signaling information to perform an airgap update.

## Processing States

The following are the various states that both `Plan`s and `Command`s
adhere to.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*]-->NewPlan
    NewPlan-->SchedulableWait
    NewPlan-->Errors*
    
    SchedulableWait-->Schedulable
    SchedulableWait-->Completed
    Schedulable-->SchedulableWait

    Errors*-->[*]
    Completed-->[*]
```

Note that the `Errors*` state is elaborated in detail below in Error States.

### NewPlan

When a `Plan` is created with the name `autopilot`, the `NewPlan` state
processing takes effect.

It is the responsibility of `NewPlan` to ensure that the status of all
the `Command`s are represented in the `Plan` status. This `Plan` status
is needed at later points in `Plan` processing to determine if the entire
`Plan` is completed.

The main difference between `NewPlan` and all the other states is that
`NewPlan` will iterate over all `Command`s; the other states deal with the
active `Command`.

### SchedulableWait

Used to evaluate a `Command` to determine if it can be scheduled for processing.
If the `Command` is determined that it can be processed, the state is set to
Schedulable.

### Schedulable

The `Schedulable` state is set by SchedulableWait to indicate that this
`Command` should execute. The execution of a `Command` in this state will be
whichever logic is defined by the `Command`.

The ending of this state should either transition to `SchedulableWait` for
further processing and completion detection, or transition to an error.

### Completed

The `Completed` state indicates that the `Command` has finished processing.
Once a `Plan`/`Command` are in the `Completed` state, no further processing
will occur on this `Plan`/`Command`.

---

## Error States

When a `Plan` or `Command` processing goes into one of the designated error
states, this is considered fatal and the `Plan`/`Command` processing will
terminate.

Error states are generally defined by the `Command` implementation.
The core autopilot functionality is only interested when in the
4 core states (`NewPlan`, `SchedulableWait`, `Schedulable`, `Completed`),
and treats all other states as an error.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Errors --> InconsistentTargets
    Errors --> IncompleteTargets
    Errors --> Restricted
    Errors --> MissingPlatform
    Errors --> MissingSignalNode
```

| Error State | Command | States | Description |
|-------------|---------|--------|-------------|
| `InconsistentTargets` | `k0supdate` | `Schedulable` | Indicates that a Signal Node probe has failed for any node that was previously discovered during `NewPlan`. |
| `IncompleteTargets` | `airgapupdate`, `k0supdate` | `NewPlan`, `Schedulable` | Indicates that a Signal Node that existed during the discover phase in `NewPlan` no longer exists (for example, a `ControlNode` or `Node` object) |
| `Restricted` | `airgapupdate`, `k0supdate` | `NewPlan` | Indicates that a `Plan` has requested an update of a Signal Node type that contradicts the startup exclusions (the `--exclude-from-plans` argument) |
| `MissingSignalNode` | `airgapupdate`, `k0supdate` | `Schedulable` | Indicates that a Signal Node that existed during the discover phase in `NewPlan` no longer exists (for example, no matching `ControlNode` or `Node` object) |

Using the example above as a reference, this outlines the basic sequence of events of
state transitions to the operations performed on each object.
